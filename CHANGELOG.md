## Development Notes

### Version 1.0.0 Development Timeline
- **Planning Phase**: December 2023
- **Core Development**: January 2024
- **Testing and Optimization**: January 2024
- **Documentation**: January 2024
- **Release**: January 15, 2024

### Key Decisions
- **AI Provider Strategy**: Chose Anthropic Claude as primary with OpenAI fallback for better rate limits and performance
- **Architecture**: Service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Deployment**: Ubuntu-focused deployment for better control and cost-effectiveness
- **UI Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router for modern React patterns
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui for consistent design system

### Performance Benchmarks
- **AI Analysis**: Average 2-3 seconds per paper
- **PubMed Search**: Average 1-2 seconds for 20 results
- **PDF Processing**: Average 1-2 seconds per MB
- **Page Load**: &lt; 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Bundle Size**: &lt; 500KB gzipped

### Security Measures
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on all API endpoints
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Environment variable protection
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

### Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for core services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing for AI services
- Security testing for vulnerabilities
- Accessibility testing for WCAG compliance

## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from Development to Production
1. Update environment variables for production
